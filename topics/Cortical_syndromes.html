<h1>Cortical Syndromes</h1>
<h3>Eﬀects of fontal lobe lesions</h3>
<table>

<tr>
<td>Site</td><td>Symptoms/signs</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="4">Unilateral</td>
<td>Contralateral spastic hemplegia<br />
Contralateral gaze paresis<br />
Apathy and loss of initiative <br />
Elevation of mood, increased talkativeness, joke inappropriately (<em>witzelsucht</em>), lack of tact, difficulty in adaptation </td>
<tr><td>Left: Broca's aphasia with agraphia, with or without apraxia of the lips and tongue; Sympathetic apraxia of left hand </td></tr>
<tr><td>Prefrontal: grasp and suck reflexes </td></tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan="2">Bilateral</td>
<td>Bilateral hemiparesis <br />
Spastic bulbar (pseudobulbar) palsy <br />
Decomposition of gait and sphincter incontinence </td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Prefrontal: abulia or akinetic mutism, lack of ability to sustain attention and solve complex problems, rigidity of thinking, bland aﬀect, social ineptitude, behavioral disinhibition, inabilty to anticipate, labile mood, and varying combiations of grasping, sucking, obligate imitative movements, utilization behavior <br />

<h3>Effects of temporal lobe lesions</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Site</td>
<td>Symptoms/signs</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Unilateral, dominant</td>
<td>Homonymous contralateral upper quadrantanopia<br /> Wernicke's aphasia (word deafness; auditory verbal agnosia)<br /> Dysnomia or amnesic aphasia<br /> Amusia (some types)<br /> Visual agnosia<br /> Occasionally, amnesic (Korsakoff) syndrome</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unilateral , nondominant</td>
<td>Homonymous upper quadrantanopia<br /> Inability to judge spatial relationships in some cases<br /> Impairment in tests of visually presented nonverbal material<br /> Agnosia for sounds and some qualities of music</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unilateral , either lobe</td>
<td>Auditory, visual, olfactory, and gustatory hallucinations <br /> "Dreamy" states with seizure (focal temporal lobe seizure)<br /> Emotional and behavioral changes<br /> Delirium-confusional states (usually nondominant)<br /> Disturbances of time perception</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bilateral</td>
<td>Korsakoff amnesic defect (hippocampal formations) <br /> Apathy and placidity<br /> Kl&uuml;ver-Bucy syndrome: compulsion to attend to all visual stimuli, hyperorality, hypersexuality, blunted emotional reactivity; the full syndrome is rarely seen in humans</td>

<h3>Effects of parietal lobe lesions</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Site</td>
<td>Symptoms/signs</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Unilateral</td>
<td>Corticosensory syndrome and sensory extinction (or total hemianesthesia with large acute lesions of white matter) <br /> Mild hemiparesis or poverty of movement (variable), poverty of movement, hemiataxia (seen only occasionally) <br /> Homonymous hemianopia or inferior quadrantanopia (incongruent or congruent) or visual inattention <br /> Abolition of optokinetic nystagmus with target moving toward side of the lesion <br /> Neglect of the opposite side of external space (more prominent with lesions of the right parietal lobe; see later)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Dominant lobe (left)</td>
<td>Disorders of language (especially alexia) <br /> Gerstmann syndrome (dysgraphia, dyscalculia, finger agnosia, right&ndash;left confusion) <br /> Tactile agnosia (bimanual astereognosis) <br /> Bilateral ideomotor and ideational apraxia </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nondominant lobe (right)</td>
<td>Visuospatial disorders <br /> Topographic memory loss <br /> Anosognosia, dressing, and constructional apraxias (these disorders may occur with lesions of either hemisphere but are observed more frequently and are of greater severity with lesions of the nondominant one) <br /> Confusion <br /> Tendency to keep the eyes closed, resist lid opening, and blepharospasm </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bilateral</td>
<td>Balint syndrome: visual-spatial imperception (simultagnosia), optic apraxia (difficulty directing gaze), and optic ataxia (difficulty reaching for objects)</td>
</tr>

<h3>Effects of occipital lobe lesions</h3>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Site</td>
<td>Symptoms/signs</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Unilateral, either side</td>
<td>Contralateral (congruent) homonymous hemianopia, which may be central (splitting the macula) or peripheral; also homonymous hemiachromatopsia <br />Elementary (unformed) hallucinations&mdash;usually because of irritative lesions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Left</td>
<td>Right homonymous hemianopia <br /> If deep white matter and splenium of corpus callosum is involved, alexia without agraphia <br /> Visual object agnosia</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Right</td>
<td>Left homonymous hemianopia <br /> With more extensive lesions, visual illusions (metamorphopsias) and hallucinations (more frequent with right-sided than left-sided lesions) <br /> Loss of topographic memory and visual orientation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bilateral</td>
<td>Cortical blindness bilateral hemianopias, <br /> Anton syndrome (visual anosognosia, denial of cortical blindness) <br /> Loss of perception of color (achromatopsia) <br /> Prosopagnosia (impaired face recognition, bilateral temporooccipital including fusiform gyrus) <br /> Balint syndrome (bilateral dorsal parietooccipital)</td>
</tr>
